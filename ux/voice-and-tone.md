## Brand Voice

Our voice is the consistent personality behind all Sacred Vows communications. It remains constant across all touchpoints.

### Voice Characteristics

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Warm** | Friendly and caring, like a supportive friend | "We're so excited to be part of your journey" |
| **Elegant** | Sophisticated without being stuffy | "Create timeless elegance" not "Make fancy invites" |
| **Helpful** | Solution-oriented and supportive | "Here's how to fix that" not "Error occurred" |
| **Celebratory** | Joyful but not over-the-top | "Beautiful! Your guests will love it" |
| **Confident** | Assured without being arrogant | "You're in good hands" |

### We Are...
- Warm and encouraging
- Helpful and knowledgeable
- Celebratory but tasteful
- Professional yet personal
- Romantic but not cheesy

### We Are Not...
- Pushy or salesy
- Cold or corporate
- Overly casual or silly
- Condescending
- Generic or robotic

## Tone Spectrum

While our voice stays consistent, our tone adapts to the situation.

### Informational (Neutral)
For documentation, FAQs, and educational content.
> "Your invitation link can be shared via text, email, or social media. Each guest who opens the link will see your personalized design."

### Encouraging (Warm)
For onboarding, tutorials, and positive feedback.
> "You're doing great! Just a few more details and your invitation will be ready to share with the world."

### Celebratory (Enthusiastic)
For success states and achievements.
> "Congratulations! Your beautiful invitation is now live. Your guests are going to love it! 🎉"

### Supportive (Empathetic)
For errors, issues, and support interactions.
> "We understand how important this is. Don't worry—we're here to help you get back on track."

### Urgent (Direct)
For critical errors or time-sensitive information.
> "Action needed: Please verify your email to continue editing your invitation."

## Writing Guidelines

### Be Clear and Concise
Get to the point quickly. Every word should earn its place.

```
✗ "In order to be able to share your invitation with your guests..."
✓ "To share your invitation..."

✗ "It is important to note that..."
✓ "Note:"
```

### Use Active Voice
Active voice is clearer and more engaging.

```
✗ "Your invitation has been saved by the system."
✓ "We've saved your invitation."

✗ "Layouts can be customized by you."
✓ "You can customize any layout."
```

### Address the User
Write directly to the person reading.

```
✗ "Users can change their password in settings."
✓ "You can change your password in settings."

✗ "One should review the invitation before sharing."
✓ "Review your invitation before sharing."
```

### Be Specific
Vague language creates confusion.

```
✗ "Something went wrong. Please try again."
✓ "We couldn't save your changes. Check your internet connection and try again."

✗ "Your invitation is great!"
✓ "Your invitation is ready to share with your 127 guests."
```

## Content Types

### Headings & Titles
- Use sentence case (not Title Case)
- Lead with the benefit or action
- Keep under 8 words when possible

```
✓ "Create your perfect invitation"
✓ "Choose a layout you love"
✗ "Welcome To The Layout Selection Page"
```

### Button Labels
- Use action verbs
- Be specific about what happens
- 1-3 words ideal

```
✓ "Start creating"
✓ "Save changes"
✓ "Share invitation"
✗ "Submit"
✗ "Click here"
✗ "Continue to the next step"
```

### Error Messages
Structure: What happened → Why → How to fix

```
✓ "We couldn't load your images. This might be a connection issue. 
   Try refreshing the page or contact support if the problem continues."

✗ "Error 500: Image load failed"
```

### Success Messages
Acknowledge the action and suggest next steps.

```
✓ "Changes saved! Preview your invitation to see how it looks."
✓ "RSVP received! We've added you to the guest list."
```

### Empty States
Guide users on what to do next.

```
✓ "No invitations yet. Create your first invitation and start 
   sharing your love story."

✗ "No data to display."
```

### Confirmation Dialogs
Be clear about the consequences.

```
✓ "Delete this invitation? This will permanently remove all your 
   designs and RSVP data. This cannot be undone."

✗ "Are you sure?"
```

## Wedding-Specific Language

### Inclusive Language
- Use "partner" or "spouse" when gender-neutral
- Don't assume traditional structures
- Support all types of celebrations

```
✓ "You and your partner"
✓ "Your wedding celebration"
✗ "Bride and groom"
✗ "Traditional wedding"
```

### Emotional Moments
Acknowledge the significance without being over-the-top.

```
✓ "Your love story deserves a beautiful beginning"
✓ "Share your joy with the world"
✗ "OMG this is THE most important day EVER!!!"
✗ "Your fairytale dream wedding awaits!"
```

### Sensitive Situations
Be thoughtful about:
- RSVPs declining
- Budget constraints
- Time pressure
- Technical difficulties close to wedding date

```
✓ "We know there's a lot to plan. We're here to make this part easy."
✓ "Beautiful invitations at every price point."
```
